# My First Blog Post

Published on: 2024-09-16

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey.

## What I've accomplished

1.- **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project.

2.- **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating a `src/pages/` folder and adding a new `.astro` file to it.

3.- **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial and then keep adding more posts.
